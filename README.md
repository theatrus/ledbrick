## LEDBrick Classic - Original Design

The original LEDBrick design consists of two main components for DIY aquarium LED lighting.

### Emitter Board

The emitter board is a custom metal-core PCBA designed to hold 8 channels of LEDs from Cree (XP footprint), Osram (SSL and Square), Luxeon (UV and Rebel footprints).

### Bluetooth Low Energy PWM Board (Legacy)

An 8 channel 24VIN + 12VOUT Fan LED dimmer board powered by a Nordic nRF51 Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller.

[Firmware is available for both Keil and GCC compilers](ledbrick-classic/firmware/nordic_nrf51/app/ble_peripheral/ledbrick_pwm/)

## Development

### Building Firmware Locally

```bash
# Install uv (Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/theatrus/ledbrick.git
cd ledbrick/firmware

# Quick build (runs tests, builds web UI, compiles firmware)
make esphome

# Individual components
make test           # Run all unit tests
make web            # Build React web interface
make web-debug      # Build non-minified web UI (for debugging)
make dev            # Start development server (set LEDBRICK_IP=device-ip)
make preview        # Serve minified build locally (debug minification)
make esphome-debug  # Build firmware with non-minified web UI
make clean-all      # Clean all build artifacts
make help           # Show all available targets
```

### Firmware Features

#### Advanced LED Control

### Development Workflow

#### Testing and Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run unit tests for core algorithms
make test                    # All tests
make test-astro             # Astronomical calculator only
make test-scheduler         # LED scheduler only
make test-clang             # Cross-compiler validation

# Web development
LEDBRICK_IP=192.168.1.xxx make dev    # Development server with device proxy
make web                              # Production build
```

#### Architecture
- **Standalone Components**: Core algorithms (astronomical calculator, LED scheduler) are pure C++ with comprehensive unit tests
- **ESPHome Integration**: Thin wrapper components that integrate with ESPHome ecosystem
- **React Frontend**: TypeScript/React web interface with responsive design
- **Clean Separation**: Core logic can be developed and tested independently of hardware

#### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Compilation Errors**: Run `make clean-all` then `make esphome` for clean rebuild
- **Sensor Configuration**: Ensure sensor IDs match ESPHome configuration exactly
- **Web Interface Debugging**: Use `LEDBRICK_IP=device-ip make dev` for development server
- **API Testing**: Access endpoints directly at `http://device-ip/api/status` etc.

### GitHub Actions

- **Continuous Integration**: Automatic build testing on firmware changes
- **Unit Test Validation**: Standalone component testing with multiple compilers  
- **Web Publishing**: Automated deployment of web installer to GitHub Pages
- **Release Management**: Tagged releases automatically build and publish firmware
