## LEDBrick Classic - Original Design

The original LEDBrick design consists of two main components for DIY aquarium LED lighting.

### Emitter Board

The emitter board is a custom metal-core PCBA designed to hold 8 channels of LEDs from Cree (XP footprint), Osram (SSL and Square), Luxeon (UV and Rebel footprints).

### Bluetooth Low Energy PWM Board (Legacy)

An 8 channel 24VIN + 12VOUT Fan LED dimmer board powered by a Nordic nRF51 Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller.

[Firmware is available for both Keil and GCC compilers](ledbrick-classic/firmware/nordic_nrf51/app/ble_peripheral/ledbrick_pwm/)
